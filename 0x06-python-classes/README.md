This directory contain code files of python classes and objects tasks in ALX
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.
Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object.
Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields.
